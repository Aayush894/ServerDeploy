Further Steps:
Running the Container Locally: After building the image, you can run it to ensure everything works as expected.

# docker run -p 8000:8000 flask
This maps port 8000 on your local machine to port 8000 in the container.

Deploying to Render:

Push your Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
Update your Render service to pull from this registry.
Docker BuildX:
Since the docker build command mentions that the legacy builder is deprecated, you might consider using Docker BuildX. To install BuildX, follow the Docker BuildX installation guide.

Once installed, you can use BuildX as follows:

sh
Copy code
# docker build -t flask .
# docker run -p 8000:8000 -d flask
# docker run -p 8000:8000 flask
